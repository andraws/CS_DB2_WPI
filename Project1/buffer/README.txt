Section I:
    For this project, the best way to run it is add it on your preferred code editor and just run the Main Method from the BufferPool Class. The program takes an argument for the buffer size. If you don't provide arguments then it would ask you to enter the buffer size.

Section II:
    Based on the test cases given, the program was able to execute all of them correctly, resulting in the proper output. I also tested it a little bit by my self and the outputs as expected.

Section III:
    I created a ContentMap class, which just has a few functions used to parse the text and a HashMap with the correct corresponding records. I also created 2 helper classes for reading and saving the data as well as one for Helping me decipher user input.
    Note, because there are 100 records, the way to get the 100th record from a file is to just enter the File with 00 after. Ex. Record 100 in file F2 = GET 100
